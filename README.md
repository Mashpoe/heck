Heck is a multi paradigm, statically typed, general purpose, compiled/JITed programming language with a C-style syntax.

Heck utilizes an extremely smart set of safety checks as well as concise type inference in order to make your code simple, safe, and readable, without making any performance sacrifices.

This repo is the first implementation of a compiler for the Heck programming language. The documentaion on how the language itself works is on the [wiki](https://github.com/Mashpoe/heck/wiki).
