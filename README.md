Heck is a multi paradigm, statically typed, general purpose, compiled/JITed programming language with a C-style syntax.

Heck utilizes extremely smart safety checks along with straightforward type inference in order to make your code simple, safe, and readable, without making any performance sacrifices.

This repo is the first implementation of a compiler for the Heck programming language. The documentation for the language can be found [here](https://heck-lang.github.io/doc).
