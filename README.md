# Heck (C implementation)

Heck is a multi paradigm, statically typed, general purpose, compiled/JITed programming language with a C-style syntax.

Heck is designed to be able to deduce types whenever possible. In most cases, the user should be able to program as if it were a dynamically-typed language.

The documentaion on how the language itself works is on the [wiki](https://github.com/Mashpoe/heck/wiki), but this repo is currently just an implementation of Heck written in C,
