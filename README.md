# Heck (C Implementation)

Heck is a multi paradigm, statically typed, general purpose, compiled/JITed programming language with a C-style syntax.

Heck is designed to be able to deduce types whenever possible. In most cases, the user should be able to write code as if it were a dynamically-typed language, but this is optional, which means the user can also be explicit about data types when they feel the need to.

The documentaion on how the language itself works is on the [wiki](https://github.com/Mashpoe/heck/wiki), as this repo is currently just a work-in-progress C implementation.
